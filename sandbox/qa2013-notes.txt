QA Hackathon 2013 session notes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use of File::ShareDir is unneeded when test-groups are stored in .pm's, like
lib/DBI/Test/001.pm (or whatever naming scheme is used). That way the groups
are easy maintainable, easy to document and easy to distribute

The test suite *will* eventually be called in a matrix-style duplication,
like defaul, again with pure-perl, again with gopher etc etc
For a *start* we will be doing the default only, keeping the duplication in
mind because we want/need something runnable as early as possible to be able
to test against DBD's and get *feedback* to see if our approach will
actually work.

The tests, as Joakim started, are a great start, but we will need the info
returned by the database most early to be able to build database specific
valid SQL statement that can be checked against DBI. This means we want to
test type_info and type_info_all early.

DBI::Test will include a DBI::Mock to serve two purposes: 1. be able to
test DBI::Test against itself, and 2. Have a test base for DBI related
modules the do not actually use a DBI but do support its API. DBI::Mock
will be subclassable.

In order to have a fail-safe way to test success against failure, we define
any statement used in the SQL area that starts with FAIL to be guaranteed
to return failure. "FAIL a from b where c = 1" is invalid.

Riba will guide Joakim in the test framework
Jens will do the DBI::Mock
Merijn will try to come to Niederrhein.pm for an extra day of hacking when
pieces of the puzzle starts needing placement. If Tim is in Europe, we should
try to combine these events.

morning session about DBI & DBD changes and additions regarding the test suite.
Notes taken by Wendy van Dijk (woolfy)

Attendees:
Merijn Brand     (Tux)
Peter Rabbitson  (ribasushi)
Kenichi Ishigaki (charsbar)
Jens Rehsack     (Sno)
Olivier Mengué   (dolmen)
Joakim Tørmoen   (trmjoa)

Tux takes the lead, this is his idea.

DBI				DBD::*
(t/s)		DBI::Test	(t/s)
		
		( 1:n )
		( * )
 
(t/s = testsuite)
(extremely overly simplified!)

Next to DBI, what modules use it how?
Make a list of DBD-interfaces that your programs, your DBD-module, or
your test module is supporting. Like: it supports MySQL and PostgreSQL
and it definitely does not support CVS.

Tux: 
Testing scope with variations (partly generated)

* Default suite
* Pure Perl
* XS
* proxies / gopher
* sql statement / sql nano

Interface on top has to be both dynamic in detection for testing, both
the DBI and DBD way & dynamic: do I support all of the matrix or not

Discuss unicode too?  
 Out of scope for now.

Different DSN's too?
 Definitely yes.

What does DBI test for itself?  It should test its own SYNOPSIS, not
all of the core docs of DBI are now tested in DBD test suites, just
part that are created/copied into the DBD test suite.

Riba: can we also focus on other things, like data type round tests,
table info.

Tux: there will be a lot overlapping
We have to make something general for DBI and then the DBD authors
need to use it, be able to use it, wanting to use it, and we don't
know yet if they want and will use it.

First: an interface to select what interface to test on.

RunTest (param1, param2, ... paramn)
	 ------------	 ----------
			*

--8<--- foo.t
use 5.016;
use_ok ("DBI::Test");
init_dbi (%config);
run_tests_ok ("This test description text");
-->8---

Some of this must be in the Makefile.PL, some in the init-file.

the use_ok and init parts should be located in Makefile.PL or Build.PL
because they will *GENERATE* the test files to be used in 'make test'

So this can live in the Makefile.

Configuration of the DSN's (and maybe more stuff) is to be done in
a configuration file in the module's root folder in JSON format
(optional support for YAML as possibility). How those will convert
into perl structures/hashes/List-Of_Hashes, ... is of later worry.

As DBI::Test will be generating tests, the *source* of the tests files
will have to be stored somewhere when DBI::Test is installed (before
DBI or DBD::* is installed - they depend on DBI::Test). File::ShareDir
is *NOT* an option, as it has unwanted dependencies not in CORE. Do we
prefer (big) .pm files or other means of resource storage? They need
to be in the perl tree under site_perl somewhere.

For now a 5-line pure-perl snippet can be used to emulate ShareDir and
add Windows support when we get something working. File::ConfigDir
might be worth stealing from.

Do we want to supper $ perl -MDBI::Test -e.... and if so, what would
it do?

The scope of DBI::Test will be the SYNOPSIS of DBI
As a start we should have a minimal test suite for
* connect
* disconnect
* do
* prepare
* execute
* fetch
* finish

Work from there to add every possible documented method and method
form from the SYNOPSIS.

DBD::Mock should come in later to allow SQL-only tests

Who does what?
riba & sno start with DBI
Tux wants to pick somebody (like the people who said they don't have a
project yet) to make individual tests. Joakim wants to start with this.
Sno starts with DBI::Test

Sno: do we have non-sql-dbd's like Adabas?
Others: not yet

Sno: we do need DBD::Mock but we don't need a DBD::Mock-driver
my %conf t
DBI->connect ($conf{whatever}, ...
